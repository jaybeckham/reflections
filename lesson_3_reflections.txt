When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you plan to work from a different computer or plan to colloborate on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that one doesn't inadvertently pull in unwanted or incomplete changes to the code base.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clone respositories on GitHub only. Repositories can be clones to your local machine. Branches can be created off of cloned repositories.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Fast-forward merges can be easily accomplished. You can resolve conflicts by having access to the previous changes of the files.
