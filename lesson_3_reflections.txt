When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you plan to work from a different computer or plan to colloborate on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that one doesn't inadvertently pull in unwanted or incomplete changes to the code base.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clone respositories on GitHub only. Repositories can be clones to your local machine. Branches can be created off of cloned repositories.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Fast-forward merges can be easily accomplished. You can resolve conflicts by having access to the previous changes of the files.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You would have to set up some sort of shared network drive or cloud based folder system to allow collaboration without using git or GitHub. This approach would be extremely difficult due to inability to track and version changes, potentially leading to a broken product. Git/GitHub solve these issues and thus is the optimal solution for collaboration.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
